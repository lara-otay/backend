#Promptify 

Promptify is an intelligent, LLM-powered backend assistant that transforms natural language into executable API requests. It provides a conversational interface—accessible via both a web-based user interface and a command-line interface (CLI)—enabling users to interact with OpenAPI-based systems using plain language. Designed specifically for developers and API consumers, Promptify streamlines the process of discovering and executing API endpoints without requiring manual inspection of schema documentation or use of traditional tools.
